# tic-tac-toe

This program creates a 3x3 board represented 
by a 2D list, where each element represents a cell on the board. The game loop handles events and draws the board on the screen. The player can click on an empty cell to make a move and the current player is displayed on the cell. The game is over when one of the player wins or the board is full.
This is a basic implementation and does not include any check for the win conditions or end of the game.
